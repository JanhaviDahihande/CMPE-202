# Implementation of the Strategy design pattern with and without using Functional style is demonstrated in the Repo.
## Comparison:

1. Original pattern:
- It consists of new classes for different strategies.
- Addition of boilerplate code in the strategy design.

2. Functional version:
- Lambda expressions passed directly instead of implementing new classes.
- Lambda exprerssions remove the boilerplate code inherent to the Strategy design pattern.
